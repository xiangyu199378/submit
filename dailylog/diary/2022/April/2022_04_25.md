２．会议

胡工帮忙找屏厂看是否可以做．
Ｅ３４ＥＳＤ结论报告．


可以让程工协助．帮忙看龙迅的固件验证．

ＲＫ　第三方，ＯＤＭ　ＰＣＢ，ＢＳＰ　源码开放给我们．
ＢＳＰ　基础的版本，ＰＣＢ版本．
我们消化　ＡＲＯＳ，下一个版本．可能要立项投入．

3. E34 静电测试结论：
（１）单屏打死，点亮时间．
（２）双屏打死，点亮时间．
（３）龙迅复位点亮时间．
（４）单屏打死，无法点亮概率．
（５）双屏打死，无法点亮概率．
（６）龙迅打死，无法复位概率．

 

４．ＥＰＳＯＮ：
Ｄear Xiao san,
I'm developer form X-visio team ,There a  question when i was do  ESD testing.
i was applying the ESD self-recover function, 
I'd like to consult you.

Has your factory done electrostatic testing? What is the minimum time required for this process? The static electricity triggers the time when the screen goes off to display.

Or whether you can store ESD reset on the screen.
Internal integrated ESD reset function,
Internal integrated ESD reset function,

The process is as follows. Please refer to the attached document for this process

There is a delay in setting parameters in the process
Users require as short a reset time as possible. Can the screen be integrated internally or by other means?
