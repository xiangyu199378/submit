3. emil report
box and glass synchronized  times functions explain:
1. box send host times to glass use hid commond(T0box).
2. box generates a pulse every 3 seconds,  glasses receive pulses and count the number of pulses(n) .
3. When  no pulses are received ,the glasses are clocked by their own internal clock(TIMCNT).
4. After 1 minute, send the latest time when the pulse was generated (T0box) again to prevent a large time error in the glasses
The following is the calculation formula:
$$
T_nglass = \begin{cases}
   T_0box &\text{if n==0  }\\
   T_0box  + 3000ms*n &\text{if n>0, receive pulse   }  \\
   T_{n-1}glass + TIMCNT &\text{other no pulse received} 
\end{cases}
$$
